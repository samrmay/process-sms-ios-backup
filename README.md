# process-sms-ios-backup
Script for retrieving sms data from an iphone backup. Outputs a csv. Created for generating training data from specific text conversations.

Rudimentary version of a more robust script for archiving messages (here)[https://github.com/samrmay/ios-message-archiver]. Will be moving all of the functionality here into that repo eventually.
